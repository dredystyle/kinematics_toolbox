"3D Kinematics" is a library for scientific data analysis, with a focus on 3d kinematics.

It is hosted under https://github.com/thomas-haslwanter/kinematics-matlab, and contains the following modules:

imus Analysis routines for IMU-recordings

        calculation of orientation from velocity, recorded with IMUs or space-fixed systems (four different algorithms are implemente here:
            simple quaternion integration
            a quaternion Kalman filter
            Madgwick’s algorithm
            Mahony’s algorithm
        calculation of position and orientation from IMU-signals
        The sub-directory sensors contains utility to import in data from xio, XSens, and yei system

markers Analysis routines for 3D movements from marker-based video recordings

        a function that takes recordings from video-systems (e.g. Optotrak) and calculates position and orientation
        calculation of joint movements from marker recordings

quat Functions for working with quaternions:

        quaternion multiplication, inversion, conjugate
        conversions to rotation matrices, axis angles, vectors
        a Quaternion class, including operator overloading for multiplication and division
        also work on data arrays

rotmat Functions for working with rotation matrices

        rotation matrices for rotations about the x-, y-, and z-axis
        symbolic rotation matrices
        conversions to Euler, Fick, Helmholtz angles

vector Functions for working with vectors

        angle between vectors
        Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization
        projection
        normalization
        rotation
        also work on data arrays
